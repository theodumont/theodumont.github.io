I am a PhD student in optimal transport at the [LIGM](https://siteigm.univ-mlv.fr/) (Université Gustave Eiffel) under the supervision of [François-Xavier Vialard]({http://angkor.univ-mlv.fr/~vialard/}), [Théo Lacombe]({https://tlacombe.github.io/}) and [Virginie Ehrlacher]({https://team.inria.fr/matherials/team-members/virginie-ehrlacher-galland/}).
Just before that, I was a research intern in infinite-dimensional Riemannian geometry at [NTU Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/spms) with [Philipp Harms](http://www.philippharms.com/) and then at [Chalmers University](https://www.chalmers.se/en/) with [Klas Modin](https://klasmodin.github.io/).
<!-- I recently completed a dual-degree MSc at [Mines Paris - PSL](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/) and [ENS Paris-Saclay (MVA)](https://www.master-mva.com/). -->

My interests span the theory of optimal transport, Riemannian geometry and machine learning, and I am passionate about the interplay between those fields. I am currently working on geometry of several OT-related problems, such as the Gromov--Wasserstein problem, and on the geometry of neural networks. I am always happy to discuss, so feel free to contact me!
